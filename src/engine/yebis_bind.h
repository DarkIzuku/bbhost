// YEBIS's resource binding, as our source instead of the game's.
//
// The YEBIS draw flip (BBHOST_GX_NATIVE_YEBIS=5) already draws from the state
// we read ourselves, but it still made seven guest calls a draw - and every one
// of them exists only to build a PM4 packet:
//
//   0x15fd230  ring open    WAIT_ON_DE_COUNTER_DIFF   (CE)
//   0x15f7840  the builder  WRITE_CONST_RAM + DUMP_CONST_RAM per stage (CE)
//   0x1473b80  WRITE_DATA                             (DE)
//   0x1477f40  tail         DMA_DATA                  (DE)
//   0x14781d0  tail         WAIT_ON_CE_COUNTER        (DE)
//   0x15fd190  ring close   INCREMENT_CE_COUNTER      (CE)
//   0x15f9d10  post-draw    INCREMENT_DE_COUNTER      (DE), and one state store
//
// What the builder is doing underneath is a double-buffered upload. Each
// bindable resource has a window in YEBIS's per-stage array at *(state + 8),
// and a bitmap saying which records in that window the game has changed.
// WRITE_CONST_RAM copies the changed records into constant RAM *at the same
// offset* - constant RAM is a mirror of the array - and DUMP_CONST_RAM copies
// the whole window out to the next slot of a 16-slot ring, so the shader reads
// a snapshot that the CPU is free to go on editing. The counters are what stop
// the ring lapping work the GPU has not finished.
//
// So the native version keeps a mirror of its own, refreshes the changed
// records into it, and hands the window to the command processor to write at
// the draw's own token - the point where the renderer resolves the descriptors,
// and the same place in the stream the dump would have been. The mirror is what
// makes it byte-for-byte: a record the game changed without marking it dirty
// must not reach the shader early, exactly as on the hardware.
//
// BBHOST_YEBIS_BIND: 0 the guest builder, 1 ours (default), 2 compare - ours
// predicts, the guest's runs, and every address is checked against it.
// BBHOST_YEBIS_BIND_VERIFY=1 also checks every window against constant RAM.
