// Changing the render resolution while the game runs, the way Dark Souls III
// PC does on the same engine: the GX device's
// resize broadcast rebuilds the scene context's targets, the post-effect
// chain and the UI scale at the new size, at a point where no frame is being
// recorded or played. The display buffers are allocated once, at the largest
// size, and the window shows the top-left of them at the render size.
//
// Off with BBHOST_LIVE_RESOLUTION=0 (the resolution then applies on the next
// run, as before), or when a hook does not go in.
