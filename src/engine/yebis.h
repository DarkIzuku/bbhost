// YEBIS's post-processing switches, which Bloodborne already has.
//
// Bloodborne's post-processing is YEBIS, and the eboot carries YEBIS's own
// debug parameter names - "Yebis-Enable MotionBlur-Dof", "LensDistortion",
// "Gaussian", "LightShaft", "ColorGrading", "Yebis-DepthOfFieldQuality" and
// about 180 more. A From debug node is registered *against the field it
// edits*, so sub_25fcf20 (the YEBIS parameter builder) hands over the offsets.
//
// So the three post-effects DS3's CSGraphicsConfig exposes are not settings
// the port has to invent - they are flags the game already keeps, and turning
// one off is writing a 0 where the game wrote a 1.

// which one the renderer reads.
