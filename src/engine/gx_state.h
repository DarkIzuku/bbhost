// GX's render-state objects as host objects.
//
// GX makes blend, depth-stencil and rasterizer state the way D3D11 does: a
// description goes through a builder (0x2578050 blend, 0x25782b0
// depth-stencil, 0x2578550 rasterizer) into an immutable object, and a draw
// binds it by pointer (pending state +0x4d0, +0x4d8, +0x240). The builder
// encodes Gnm registers into the object, and the command processor has been
// decoding those registers back at every draw. This registry keeps what the
// game asked for instead: the description, which each builder also copies
// into the object, parsed into the fields below under an id the draw carries.
//
// Objects are identified by content, at the first draw that binds them.
// Hooking the creators (0x25658e0, 0x25659a0, 0x2565a80) sees almost none
// of them: the engine calls the builders itself on temporaries and copies the
// results where its draws bind them (0x25aeca0 alone builds 15 blend, 6
// depth-stencil and 12 rasterizer states), and GX builds its own defaults in
// place (0x2ad3280, 0x2ad3a00). So the recording thread, at the draw call,
// fingerprints the object's register words and looks its address up; a new
// or changed object is parsed from its own copy of the description.
//
// GX's enums are D3D11's, 0-based (the tables at 0x4c6fc50, 0x4c6fca0,
// 0x4c6fcc0, 0x4c6fe20): blend factors ZERO..INV_SRC1_ALPHA without D3D11's
// gap; ops ADD SUBTRACT REV_SUBTRACT MIN MAX, stencil ops KEEP..DECR and
// compare NEVER..ALWAYS in Vulkan's order; fill 0 solid, cull 0/1/2 none,
// front, back.
//
// An object's address is a lookup key only while the object is alive, and
// the command processor draws long after the game recorded the draw, when
// the address may belong to a newer object. So the id is taken at the call
// (gx_trace.cpp's snapshot) and travels with the draw. Ids name interned
// descriptions: identical states share one, and none is ever reused.
//
// BBHOST_GX_STATE=0 leaves it off; =2 (compare) checks, at every draw that
// carries ids, the Vulkan state the descriptions give against what the
// register path gives (render.cpp) and reports the differences at exit.
