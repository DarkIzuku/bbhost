// UnpackHalf2x16, a driver may fold UnpackHalf2x16(PackHalf2x16(x)) back to x
// and so drop the half-precision rounding, depending on what lies between the
// two: on the RTX 4070 driver most translated shaders were folded and
// 3eaa5555+dbeccd9c was not, so the same export differed by one target quantum
// between translation and lift.
// Decoding with exact integer and ldexp operations cannot be folded, so every
// pipeline keeps the rounding and the two builders agree on any driver.
