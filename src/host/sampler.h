// A wall-clock sampling profiler for host threads, for finding where the
// command processor's frame time goes when a good part of it is not CPU.
//
// BBHOST_SAMPLE=bb-cp0,bb-present   threads to sample, by name prefix
// BBHOST_SAMPLE_HZ=997              samples a second per thread
// BBHOST_SAMPLE_OUT=build/samples   writes <out>.txt (one stack a line:
//                                   flip, tid, return addresses) and
//                                   <out>.maps (/proc/self/maps)
//
// Each tick signals the thread (SIGPROF) whether it is running or blocked,
// and the handler unwinds its stack, so a futex or a driver wait shows up
// as the frames that called it. tools/wallprof.py symbolizes and sums the
// stacks.
//
// Guest threads can be sampled too, by their guest names, or "main" for the
// game's main loop (every unnamed guest thread is "bbhost"): the handler moves to the thread's host FS before it
// touches anything, and puts the guest's back. Interrupted in guest code it
// walks the guest's frame pointers (the eboot keeps them) and marks those
// addresses with a leading 'g' - they are Binary Ninja addresses; in host
// code (an HLE call) it unwinds the host frames.

// on this thread abandons that sample and does not return. Otherwise a no-op.

// When no flip comes for BBHOST_WATCHDOG_S seconds (15; 0 off), every
// thread's stack at the stall's start and 30 s on (named, host frames as
// module+offset, guest ones as Binary Ninja addresses; tools/hang_stacks.py
// names ours). For runs on machines the log is all we get from: one that
// stops without a crash report then says whether it hung and where.
// Windows: from the start, with a line every 5 s, the threads suspended to
// read them. Linux: once the game has flipped 60 times, each thread's stack
// taken by its own SIGPROF handler (a signal can cut a blocking call short,
// so not during the start).
