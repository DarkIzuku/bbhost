// The setup window: a small window of its own (Dear ImGui on SDL3's 2D

// game's paths are missing or wrong, when bbhost starts with --setup, or at
// every start when startup.setup_window says so. It sets the game folder and
// the eboot (with the system's folder and file pickers, and a check of each),
// the data folder, the online server, a few start-up settings (the same ones
// the F10 screen has, through host_opt_*) and update checks, and writes them
// to the per-user bbhost.toml (config_user_file) in place. Never in a headless
// run.
