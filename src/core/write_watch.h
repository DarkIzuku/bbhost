// Write tracking for guest memory the host keeps a copy of: the texture
// cache's surfaces. A surface's pages are made read-only when it is uploaded,
// the first write to one of them faults, and the fault makes that page
// writable again and records that it was written. The next bind of the
// surface sees the written page and uploads it again - on the next frame,
// not whenever a hash of its memory is next due.
//
// The hashes it replaces could only poll, and polling cost what it read, so
// a surface that had sat unchanged was rechecked every 2 s: a glyph drawn
// into an idle menu atlas took up to that long to appear. The shadPS4 texture
// cache works this way too (its page manager write-protects the pages behind
// cached images and a write fault marks them dirty).
//
// Each 4 KiB host page has one entry: 0 when no surface was ever armed on it,
// otherwise the sequence number of its last write (or of the last change to
// its mapping). A watch records the sequence number it was armed at and is
// dirty when any of its pages carries a later one. Every step is ordered so
// that no write goes unseen:
//
//   arm:    load the change count, load the sequence, then protect - and only
//           then does the caller read the memory it uploads;
//   fault:  make the page writable, take a sequence number, store it in the
//           entry, then bump the change count;
//   check:  load the change count - unchanged since the last check means no
//           page anywhere was written - else scan the watch's pages.
//
// Only direct memory is armed (hle_kernel_write_watch): Vulkan imports it
// through its own mirror mapping, so the guest's view can be protected without
// touching an import. Writes that do not go through the watched view are not
// seen: GX and the command processor write through the GPU alias. The buffer
// shadow arms the alias as well (hle_kernel_write_watch_alias); the texture
// cache keeps a slow hash as the backstop instead.
//
// BBHOST_WRITE_WATCH=0 turns it off. On Windows the protection is
// VirtualProtect and the fault a vectored exception handler
// (write_watch_install, first in line); the section views the guest memory
// lives in take page protections like any private mapping, and Vulkan reads
// the memory through its own mirror view, which stays writable.
