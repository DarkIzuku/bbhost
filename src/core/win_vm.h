// The guest's address space on Windows.
//
// The eboot wants its direct memory at fixed addresses (kernel.cpp: CPU
// window at 4 GiB, GPU alias window at 0xff00000000) and maps 16 KiB pages
// of a 6 GiB backing at 64 KiB-aligned offsets. Linux does that with
// MAP_FIXED over a memfd. Windows has no fixed-address replace: a view of a
// file mapping lands only where the space is free, and anything else may
// have taken the address first (under wine the process heap lands at
// exactly 4 GiB). So the windows are reserved as *placeholders* before
// anything else runs (VirtualAlloc2 + MEM_RESERVE_PLACEHOLDER), a mapping
// carves the placeholder to its exact range and replaces it with a view
// (MapViewOfFile3 + MEM_REPLACE_PLACEHOLDER), and an unmapping gives the
// placeholder back (UnmapViewOfFile2 + MEM_PRESERVE_PLACEHOLDER). Partial
// unmaps of a view unmap it whole and remap the kept parts from the same
// section, so the guest's munmap of part of a mapping behaves.
//
// Flexible (anonymous) guest memory is a private pagefile section per
// mapping, mapped the same way, so it too can be partially released.
// Everything is 64 KiB granular: Windows requires view offsets and bases on
// the allocation granularity, and every mapping the game makes is (the
// Linux smoke: 14 direct maps, all 64 KiB aligned and linear).
//
// Nothing here exists on Linux; kernel.cpp's Windows branches call it.
