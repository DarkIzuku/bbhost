"""Summarize the rendering warnings in a run log, one line per class.

    tools/log_health.py build/<run>/run.log [more logs...]

Each class is a way a frame has gone wrong before, as the host logs it; the
count is how many lines the log has (most classes log only their first few
occurrences, so a count at its cap means "at least"), and the first line is
shown. The exit report's own totals (draw failures and their reasons, stale
reads, region copies, level aliases, dummy images) are quoted as they are.
tools/f12_check.py reads a dump the same way.
