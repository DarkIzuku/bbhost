/* bbhost plugin API, version 10.
 *
 * A plugin is a shared library (.so on Linux, .dll on Windows) in
 * <exe dir>/plugins or <data>/plugins. The host loads every one at start and
 * calls, in this order:
 *
 *   int bb_plugin_init(const BbHostApi* api);    before the eboot is loaded:
 *                                                log, config, register_hle
 *   int bb_plugin_image(const BbHostApi* api);   after the eboot is loaded and
 *                                                patched: read, write, patch,
 *                                                hook, guest_addr (optional)
 *
 * and reads `bb_plugin_info` (a BbPluginInfo, optional) before either. C++
 * plugins get the engine's layouts, symbols and typed params from
 * include/bbhost/ (bbhost/sdk.hpp is the entry point).
 *
 * Both return 0 to stay loaded; anything else unloads the plugin with a log
 * line. Everything is plain C with the platform's default calling
 * convention, except a function handed to register_hle: the game calls it
 * with the PS4's SysV ABI, so it must carry BB_GUEST_ABI (Clang and GCC on
 * Windows; MSVC cannot express it, so register_hle is not for MSVC-built
 * plugins). Hook callbacks are ordinary C functions; the host adapts.
 *
 * Addresses are Binary Ninja's for the 1.09 eboot (the image at its preferred
 * base 0x400000). guest_addr() turns one into the runtime address; the read,
 * write, patch and hook calls take Binary Ninja addresses themselves.
