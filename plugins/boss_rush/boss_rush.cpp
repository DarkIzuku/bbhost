// Boss rush: an official bbhost plugin (docs/plugins.md).
//
// The game's bosses one after another: each round wakes a boss (its defeat
// flag cleared), carries the player to a lamp of its map and on to just
// outside its fog wall, and waits for the defeat flag to come back on. A
// death retries the round, from the fog wall again. When the last one falls,
// the time and the deaths are on screen and in
// <data>/plugins/boss_rush/results.txt, every flag the run changed is put
// back as the save had it, and the player is back in the Hunter's Dream.
//
// Start, skip and stop it from the in-game plugin menu (its settings are
// there and in the plugin manager at launch; the file form:)

// the lamps each defeat lights (tools/mapval_lamps.py's "requires" column);
// the fog walls from the same scripts and the maps' layouts.
